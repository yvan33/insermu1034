evolve is a multi-purpose WordPress theme that has recently been redesigned as 
a full responsive theme for all devices. The theme includes a slick parallax 
slider with up to 5 slides on any page and a post slider for 10 posts per post
category. There are a number of different slider and animated effects to move 
captions and images into position and then back out of frame again. Button and 
arrow navigation elements are shown on each slider, or slides can be 
automatically cycled through. Bootstrap construction makes it easy to change 
designs around because the theme is build on a grid-like system. Modify anything 
with the design, such as the logo, header, background, main colors used, 
and more. The FontAwesome icon pack provides Retina Ready icons that look 
terrific on an iPad or other HD device and at any resolution. Animate.css 
plug-in is included for slick CSS interactive effects which can be included on
many different pages to create interesting animations. There are more than 
500 Google web fonts which ensures almost infinite selection of just the right 
fonts selectable for headings, sub-headings and web copy in any size, color or 
style. Image thumbnails have attractive borders and an image zoom effect when 
hovered over. Multiple blog layouts includes single column, two or 3 columns 
in a grid or a post with a featured image. There are 12 widget areas, four in 
the header, four in the footer and 2 in the sidebar. Add your own custom widgets
to include new functionality into a page such as an improved opt-in box, 
featured posts, archives and more. Two widgets are included in the theme: 
Tabs (recent posts, popular posts and comments) and the Carousel slider. 
In order to get the word out, social media accounts are well promoted. 
Up to 10 networks are supported including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, 
Pinterest, and Google+. Choose which logos to display at the bottom of each post
and what size the social media icons should be. There are easy navigation 
elements like a revolving main menu where menu items rotate and highlight 
when hovered over, categories and tags are shown at the bottom of each post, 
a "back to top" navigation "up" arrow is shown on each page and breadcrumb 
navigation is also available to help visitors avoid getting lost in large sites.
evolve also includes a contact page template with Google Map.
